# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Publish `otel-init` `0.33.1` as the successor to `tracing-opentelemetry-extra` `0.33.0`. These are separate crates.io packages; Cargo does not migrate dependencies automatically.

### Migration

- Replace `tracing-opentelemetry-extra = "0.33.0"` with `otel-init = "0.33.1"` in `Cargo.toml`.
- Replace Rust imports from `tracing_opentelemetry_extra` with `otel_init`.
- The old `tracing-opentelemetry-extra` package remains available at `0.33.0` until it is yanked after the successor is published.

## Predecessor history

The entries below were published under the `tracing-opentelemetry-extra` package name.

## [0.33.0](https://github.com/nivek-ph/tracing-otel-extra/compare/tracing-opentelemetry-extra-v0.32.1...tracing-opentelemetry-extra-v0.33.0)

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Upgrade OpenTelemetry dependencies to `0.32` and `tracing-opentelemetry` to `0.33`. Downstream crates must use matching OpenTelemetry versions.
- Remove `Clone` from `OtelGuard` so dropping a duplicate cannot shut down shared OpenTelemetry providers early.

## [0.31.8](https://github.com/nivek-ph/tracing-otel-extra/compare/tracing-opentelemetry-extra-v0.31.7...tracing-opentelemetry-extra-v0.31.8)




### Fixed


- *(opentelemetry)* Skip OTLP exporters when no endpoint is configured ([#21](https://github.com/nivek-ph/tracing-otel-extra/pull/21)) - ([4e614fe](https://github.com/nivek-ph/tracing-otel-extra/commit/4e614fe45568da3682ce2e4db4eb32a7317b3dd8))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Initialize local OpenTelemetry providers without OTLP exporters when no endpoint is configured or endpoint env vars are empty, avoiding default localhost:4317 connection attempts.

## [0.31.5](https://github.com/nivek-ph/tracing-otel-extra/compare/tracing-opentelemetry-extra-v0.31.4...tracing-opentelemetry-extra-v0.31.5)
